# Prepare files to load dataframe in `Battery Dataset` directory
Unzip `Cycle Data` and all `Time Data #` zip files <br>
Create `Time Data` directory <br>
Move all files from `Time Data #` directories to `Time Data` directory <br>
Delete the now empty `Time Data #` directories <br>
Restart and run all for "Battery_Dataset" python notebook <br>
Use "Starter" python notebook to write new code <br>

# Battery Descriptor file
Added code to turn an array from the GUI into a numerical array to feed into MLM

# Graphical User Interface

The SELEC module uses streamlit (https://streamlit.io/), a Python-based GUI that runs on the user's browser. 

To use, the user must first install streamlit to their environment 
-->(will add directions to this later).

Then, run the following command on their terminal: streamlit run selec_gui.py
--> this will soon be changed to maybe the github link instead of a local py file
--> we can maybe even write a file that just does this for people? idk lol
