# SELEC
*Description of SELEC program*

-----
## Graphical User Interface

The SELEC module uses streamlit (https://streamlit.io/), a Python-based GUI that runs on the user's browser. 

*Link to GUI*

Then, run the following command on their terminal: 

`streamlit run selec_gui.py`

--> this will soon be changed to maybe the github link instead of a local py file

*Tutorial -> image of how to input -> image of resulting plots
