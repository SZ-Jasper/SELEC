# Graphical User Interface

The SELEC module uses streamlit (https://streamlit.io/), a Python-based GUI that runs on the user's browser. 

To use, the user must first install streamlit to their environment 
-->(will add directions to this later).

Then, run the following command on their terminal: streamlit run selec_gui.py
--> this will soon be changed to maybe the github link instead of a local py file
--> we can maybe even write a file that just does this for people? idk lol
